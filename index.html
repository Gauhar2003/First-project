<h3 style="background-color:pink;">Waterfall model</h3>
<p>The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential project management approach where each phase of a project must be completed before the next phase begins. It's often used in software development, where it's characterized by distinct phases like requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.</p> 
<h3 style="background-color:blue;">Prototype model</h3>
<p>A prototype model in software engineering is a preliminary version or working model of a product or system, built to demonstrate its functionality, features, and design concepts. It's used to gather feedback, test ideas, and validate requirements before full-scale development. Essentially, it's a "rough draft" of the final product, allowing stakeholders to</p>
<h3 style="background-color:Green;">Spiral model</h3>
<p>The Spiral Model is a software development model that combines iterative development with a strong focus on risk management. It's a cyclical process, meaning it progresses through distinct phases (planning, risk analysis, engineering, evaluation) repeatedly, with each loop building upon the previous one. This iterative nature allows for early identification and mitigation of risks, making it suitable for complex and large-scale projects.</p>
